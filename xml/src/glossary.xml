                    Players often have several types of pieces

                    If only one type of piece is available,
                    stronger pieces can be represented by stacks
                    of pieces.

                    These pieces are like standard pieces, but
                    they have a specific move which is
                    determined by their shape. The move is the
                    same in any game that uses the piece.

                <dd>
                    Some chess pieces
                    use a different move when they are capturing
                    another piece.

                    In some games, chess pieces can be transformed into
                    other pieces. This is normally shown by replacing the
                    piece with a spare (or captured) piece, or by
                    improvising. Rules vary.

                    These pieces have a significant direction.

                    are only used for directional pieces and are always

                    In some games, each player "owns" one side of the
                    board. This side is the "near" side for their pieces,
                    and the opposite side is the "far" side.
                    Unless otherwise stated, the significant direction of all pieces
                    is from near to far.
