                    When pieces belong to the same player for the entire game,
                    they are shown next to the player symbol <player value="black" />.

                    These pieces face in a particular direction.
                    It may or may not be legal to rotate them.

                If pieces change their owner over the course of a game,
                or they do not have a particular owner, they are shown below the
                list of players.

                    may give a clue to how it moves

                All games are divided into phases.

                The <i>Setup</i> phase includes any activity that needs to be done before the game starts.
                Either player can do this, or both. There are no decisions
                to make that could affect the game.

                The player symbols
                <player value="black"/> and <player value="white"/>
                denote where the players are taken to be sitting.

                are relative to a player or some other piece on the board.
                If not specified, these terms are relative to the player who owns the piece.

                in practice it's normally clear which is meant, and games rarely

                <player value="black"/>
                always takes the first decision.
                If you prefer white to start
                (for example, in chess), imagine the same rules
                with the colours reversed.

                After setup, the game moves to phase <i>A</i>, with <player value="black" />
                to play. 
                <goToPhase>
                    <phaseRef value="A"/>
                    <player value="black"/>

                <player value="black"/>
                (<player value="white"/>)
                <comment>means that although the rule is described for
                <player value="black"/>,
                it will also apply for
                <player value="white"/>
                (with the colours reversed)
                when it is their turn to play.

                <keyword>move</keyword> has a special meaning in the rules to this game,

                After
                <player value="black"/> makes their move,
                we go to phase <i>A</i> with
                <player value="white"/>
                to play.
                Because
                <player value="white" />
                will follow the same rule as
                <player value="black" />
                did, this phase
                will continue until
                a different rule comes into effect.
                This is shown by a double arrow:
            <repeat>
                <goToPhase>
                    <phaseRef value="A" />
                    <player value="white" />
                </goToPhase>
            </repeat>

            <subphase>
                A <piece colour="black" shape="rook" />
                and a 
                <piece colour="white" shape="rook" />
                occupy abutting spaces
                <goToPhase>
                    <phaseRef value="B"/>
                    <player value="black"/>
                </goToPhase>
                <p><comment>
                    This is an extra rule which
                    applies during phase <i>A</i>
                    under certain conditions.
                    <player value="black"/>
                    must follow it instead of the main flow
                    if the condition is met at the beginning of their turn.
                    In this example, the game moves to phase <i>B</i>
                    with <player value="black"/> to play.
